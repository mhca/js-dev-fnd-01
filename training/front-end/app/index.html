            We're here to get you started with JavaScript! In the twenty plus years since its inception, JavaScript has
            become the lingua franca of the web, that's to say, it's become the main tool to create interactive content
            on the Internet.

            In this course, you'll explore the JavaScript programming language by creating an interactive version of
            your résumé. You’ll learn the JavaScript programming fundamentals you need while building new elements and
            sections to enhance your résumé.

            Today, front-end developers work with web designers to create the interactive experiences that make the web
            the addictive playground we know and love. As the size and influence of the web have expanded, so has the
            importance of ensuring a website offers users an unforgettable experience.

            Perhaps your end goal is to create a HTML5 game, code the front-end for an app idea you have, or maybe you
            want to use one of the growing set of libraries that let you compile code written in another language or for
            another platform down to JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can do all these things and more.
